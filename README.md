## Make a planisphere to demonstrate the precession of the equinoxes

See https://in-the-sky.org/precession/index.php for more information.

To make the default planisphere models, run the shell script `main_planisphere.sh`.

### Further information

The precession of the equinoxes is a gradual changing in the direction of the
Earth's rotation axis, which causes the position of the celestial poles to
drift through the constellations at a continuous rate of roughly 20 arcseconds
per year. Although this effect is small on short timescales, the accumulated
drift adds up to about one Moon diameter per century.

Currently the Earth's north celestial pole points close to the star Polaris,
but this will not always be the case.  By 2500, Polaris will be several degrees
away from the true celestial pole.

A conventional planisphere is a simple hand-held device which shows a map of
which stars are visible in the night sky at any particular time. By adapting
the design of the planisphere, it is possible to build a similar instrument
which, instead of demonstrating the rotation of the night sky around the
celestial poles, instead demonstrates the movement of the celestial poles due
to the precession of the equinoxes.

I have created kits for building two models of planisphere for demonstrating
the precession of the equinoxes. One shows the effect of the precession of the
equinoxes on the northern sky.  Specifically, it shows the precession of the
north celestial pole through the northern sky. The other shows the effect of
the precession of the equinoxes on the southern sky.
